Your work in BookLab will unfold through these major assignments:

## 1. Discussion Prep

### Assignment Overview

+ Weekly
+ Students work individually
+ 3 declarative and/or interrogative sentences each week
+ Gathered in a notebook (physical or digital)
+ Due by the beginning of the pertinent class period

### Assignment Details

For each week of class there are readings listed under _Core_ and _Penumbra_. The core readings are just that: central to the week's discussion and lab. Everyone should read these closely and prepare to discuss them. The penumbral readings try to capture a broader spectrum of scholarship pertinent to each week's theme, which I could not require because time is, sadly, finite. Each week you should choose one of the penumbral readings, based on your own interests, to read and be prepared to reference as a means of expanding our conversation together.

To prepare for our discussions, each week you should draft 2-3 substantial questions or critical observations that highlight details of interest from the core (and your chosen penubral) readings, connect ideas across the week's readings (or even across different weeks), or probe the boundaries or limitations of the assigned texts. The goal of this assignment is not to test your knowledge of our readings, but to prompt dialog, so I try not to be prescriptive. In general, however, your discussion prep should:

1.  Get beyond basic questions or observations of fact and instead work toward questions or observations of significance.
2.  Demonstrate close thought about the frameworks of our texts, as well as about the relationships among them.
3.  Emerge from (and refer to) specific ideas, pages, quotations, scenes, &c. from our specific assigned texts rather than broad or generic concepts.
4.  Genuinely open toward discussion and debate during class (i.e. no leading the witness, your honor).
5.  I would add to these one more, which I do not require but which I always encourage: Engage with our texts through a spirit of [[generous thinking](https://generousthinking.hcommons.org/1-introduction/critique-and-competition/)](https://generousthinking.hcommons.org/1-introduction/generous-thinking/). I try to include a range of perspectives in our readings, and you will certainly disagree with some ideas in some of them. I assign a number of articles with which I disagree, because they articulate ideas I believe worthy of serious consideration! As we read and discuss together, we will find [many opportunities for critique](https://generousthinking.hcommons.org/1-introduction/critique-and-competition/), so I would encourage you to work first toward understanding and contextualization—to pause, just a moment, when you feel that first impulse toward deconstruction to consider whether you are reading generously or suspiciously, and whether the mode you have chosen is in fact the right one for the rhetorical moment. Class discussion is not the same as social media, and our in-class takes need not always be the hottest possible.

Particularly in a graduate class, students are often tempted to write 3 lengthy paragraphs, but I strongly urge you to stick to 3 well-developed sentences, either declarative (an observation) or interrogative (a question). 

I will not collect your discussion prep each week. This does not mean, however, that you should keep your discussion prep in your mind or try to wing it—I do expect you to write your prep down before class, in either a physical or digital notebook. You should be prepared to reference your prep directly when asked during discussion or when it is pertinent to in-class group work, or to show your prep notebook to me on request.

## 2. Dead Media Poster

### Assignment Overview

+ A conference-style poster about a "dead" medium's history
+ Students work in pairs
+ Due for in-class poster session on Monday, March 4

### Assignment Details

In [“Imagining the New Media Encounter,"](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-3-1&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ss1-3-1&brand=9781405148641_brand) Alan Liu suggests that “The déjá vu haunting of new by old media is clear enough.” New technologies and new modes of communication draw, both technically and metaphorically, from older modes—including “dead media” that have, to all surface appearances, entirely disappeared. To better understand this haunting, you will work in pairs to research a historical new medium and/or technology that flourished and then faded from popular view: some might call this [“media archaeology.”](http://mediaarchaeologylab.com/) These new media might be very old indeed or relatively new: new textual technologies have emerged since the invention of writing—if not earlier—while some popular technologies introduced as recently as a decade ago are already obsolete. 

#### How 'Dead' is Dead?

I would ask that you employ a relatively strict, but not pedantic, definition of “dead media”: it should mean less than “completely and totally banished from human culture” but more than “no longer hip.” To put this idea another way: a small community of dedicated enthusiasts should not rescue a technology from being called “dead media,” but neither should we prematurely kill off a medium that is still in wide use, even if many users have moved on (think of CDs, which are now resurgent but even at their least hip had a significant community of older users). As future librarians and information professionals, I would encourage you not to fall into generational fallacies or the planned obsolescence
cycles of Silicon Valley when naming media either vibrant or dead!

#### Resources for Finding a Medium

You might consider this list from the original [Dead Media Project](http://www.deadmedia.org/notes/index-numeric.html) or from the [Dead Media Archive](http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Main_Page) as you plan your topic. Importantly, however, you will note that these resources are quite old, for webpages and will necessarily not include media that have died since they were written, such as (arguably?) Flash websites. When choosing your medium, opt for the unfamiliar and the strange if at all possible—try to find a medium you suspect your colleagues have never heard of, or perhaps one they will _think_ they know until its reality surprises them. 

For spring 2024 I am issuing a preemptiveve veto on just one medium: [the language of flowers](http://cultureandcommunication.org/deadmedia/index.php/Language_of_Flowers). I understand why this medium appeals to students, but it appeals _so very much_ to students that every single semester I have given this assignment at least one group—and sometimes more than one group!—chooses it. To be frank, I just need a break.

#### Group Signup & Medium Claim

You should work to find a partner for this project as soon as possible. If you are having trouble finding someone, let me know and I can help. Once you have a parter, choose a medium and then [use this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12AtpekL4X93_OwXT9_FxoP551DiikVKcNwT2Aka28fg/edit?usp=sharing) to let me know who's in your team and to claim your medium. If someone else has already chosen your medium, you'll need to pick again—we don't want repeats during the poster session.

#### The Poster

You will prepare a conference-style poster to present your “dead medium” to your classmates and instructor. If you’ve never created a research poster, consult the references on [the “poster session” Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poster_session) for writing and design tips. Your poster should address on the following questions:

1. How did this medium build on, innovate, diverge, or respond to earlier media? What precisely was new about it when it was the “new medium?” Remember that for contemporaneous people, these media were every bit as strange, exciting, or terrifying as the most cutting edge advances are to us today.
2. What were the cultural effects of this medium during its heyday? Did it produce substantive changes in domestic life, politics, art, or other spheres? Were there cultural changes its creators sought, either successfully or unsuccessfully, to institute through the medium?
3. Were there competing media that attempted to meet the same needs or fill the same niche as your chosen medium? How did this competition play out?
4. How and why did your medium decline in importance?
5. What were the lasting effects or products of your medium? Was it a media “dead end” or did new media evolve from it? How does your medium linger in descendants, images, memory, or language?

You should not attempt on your poster to tell us everything that you might say about your chosen medium in a written paper, nor explain its every nuance. When designing your poster, think CONCISE, INFORMATIVE, and CREATIVE. Students often choose to create a model or interactive aspect to their poster to help their colleagues understand their medium. The idea here is that the form’s restriction (paradoxically) promotes your creativity, as some might argue the formal restrictions of certain poetic forms force the poet toward ever-more-deft feats of language. You will have ample opportunity during the poster session to share more details and anecdotes from your research than you can fit onto your poster (or into your model) itself.

## 3. Final Book Project

### Assignment Overview

+ An original bookish object project students will conceive, develop, and produce over the semester
+ Students work individually or collaboratively
+ Proposal due March 20, prototype due April 10
* Project & artist's statement due by showcase on Monday, April 29

### Acknowledgment

Thanks to Matthew Kirschenbaum for sharing materials from his [BookLab course](https://english.umd.edu/academic-programs/courses/ENGL428M)'s final project assignment, which substantially shaped this one.

### Assignment Details

Your final project in BookLab will be an original bookish object—as a shorthand for the purposes of this assignment writeup, "a book"—of your own design and making. As we will see in our readings, labs, and other investigations, the word “book” can mean many things and your projects can likewise take many forms and include a range of media: e.g. a letterpress chapbook, a zine, an altered book, an interactive digital book, a book "kit," or something else. As we move through our activities, you should be thinking about which media, technologies, and techniques you might wish to incorporate into your project. 

You may work individually or collaboratively on these projects, with the understanding that collaborative projects should reflect more work in proportion to the size of their respective teams. You will also submit an artist’s statement (~1000 words) to accompany your project, which will describe its concept and ambitions, its influences, your process, and challenges.

The content of your book will be entirely up to you. You might draw on a favorite topic of research, a hobby, or a cultural interest, among other possibilities. Your book can be informational, scholarly, experimental, artistic, entertaining, or—most likely—some combination of those. Your book may be a singular object or a multiple, and some mediums—like zines—will dictate the latter. Your book can contain original content or remediate existing material (though if you choose the latter, we will need to work together to ensure we follow intellectual property laws). What is essential, however, is that your book demonstrates—through its form, content, or a combination of the two—your critical engagement with the themes and media of our course. 

Below are some general design models you could consider adopting, but other models are possible, and hybrid approaches that blend media are encouraged:

+ _Altered or Treated Book_: using an already existing book as your platform, alter or treat it in some fashion. You might think in terms of things to subtract (removing pages, cutting or inking out words, other forms of erasure), and you might also think of things to add, insert, or otherwise augment what’s already there. There are lots of possibilities here.
+ _Zine_: a zine must consist of an “original” plus duplicates. It should have a clear topic or focus. It must also consist of some evidence of copies already distributed (for instance, photographs of them “in the wild”), and a plan for future issues and further expanding your production and distribution.
+ _Letterpress Chapbook_: a small chapbook for which you set the type and fold and bind the printed sheets in the form of a codex. It will be important to keep your expectations modest and to start early. You might also think in terms of “letterpress accents” to a text you print digitally, rather than using letterpress for the entire work. Or else think more creatively: for example, using a small number of words and the shapes of letters artistically; printing a single setting of type multiple times in different ways; and so on. Less is more. Please discuss with me ASAP.
+  _Book Kit_: the idea here is a book, or the makings of a book, in a box. The box or container becomes part of the work, and should convey something meaningful to those who find it. Things to think about include whether a reader is meant to assemble (and disassemble) the book for themselves, what all goes into the box, and how it is meant to be encountered (In a public place? Randomly? Addressed to a specific individual?)
+  _Interactive Digital Book_: this kind of book can develop in many directions, but a digital book should employ and forefront the possibilities of digital media through affordances such as linking, interactivity, changeability, etc. Like the other options, these books should be explicit and thoughtful about their medium. They should, in other words, be books that could only exist as digital books, not simply books that happen to be on the web. 

#### Project Milestones

This project will be your cultimating intellectual contribution to BookLab. In order to ensure you fully develop your idea, we will observe several milestones throughout the semester. The due dates listed here are the latest possible dates for each milestone, but you are free to submit each earlier, particularly if you anticipate revisions.

##### 1. Proposal: Wednesday, March 20

By Wednesday, March 20—essentially, just after spring break—you will submit a proposal outlining the book project you hope to complete, as well as the steps required to do so. Each proposal should describe:

1.  The content of your book. What will it be about?
2.  The format of your book. Will it be printed and bound? A zine? An ebook? A hybrid? Something else?
3.  The skills you will need in order to execute your project, as well as a plan for acquiring those skills, particularly if they are not skills we will formally study together. 
4.  The materials you will need to complete your project, as well as a plan for acquiring these materials. Skeuomorph may be able to help with acquring some equipment, but I will have to assess the feasibility of this funding on a case-by-case basis.
5.  The equipment you will need in order to complete your project, as well as a plan for accessing that equipment.
6.  The team working on your book. Is this an individual or group project? If the latter, what does each member bring to the group?
7.  A plan for evaluating the project. What are your goals for this book, and how will we know whether and to what extent those goals have been met?

We will discuss your proposals together in order to ensure they are well defined and scoped appropriately. All proposals need to be accepted before you move on to the next stage of development.

##### 2. Prototype: Wednesday, April 10

By Wednesday, April 10 you will submit a prototype demonstrating the viability of your project proposal. What you will submit during the prototype stage will vary widely by project, but it should essentially be a proof of concept: evidence that the plan you outlined in your proposal is feasible and that you are on track toward completion. Among other possibilities, you might submit:

1.  A few pages from a longer analog project in process
2.  A set of conceptual drawings or wireframes illustrating your progress
3.  A stylesheet and sample page(s) from a digital project

The prototype is due at the mid-point of the project's development from proposal to showcase. The primary goal for the prototype stage is demonstrating steady progress, and ensuring that your plans remain feasible. If your project has significantly shifted from what was proposed and accepted at the proposal stage, the prototype stage will also be the point at which you will submit a revised project proposal.

##### 3. Professor Meeting: Between March 21 and April 22

Sometime during your work on the project, you (and your collaborators, if relevant) must meet with me individually to discuss your project and progress. You are certainly invited to meet with me more than once, but at least one meeting is required.

##### Final Project: Monday, April 29

Your project should result in a final object, set of objects, or digital artifact, as well as an artist(s) statement describing what you have accomplished in your project. These will be due a little before the end of the semester, in time for the final project showcase during the last two days of class.

###### Artist(s) Statement

Your final project must include an artist(s) statement—a reflection, essentially—of approximately 1000 words which outlines your book's concept and ambitions, its influences, your process, and challenges. Be sure to address what you learned in the process of making the book, and describe what your book means to you in the end.

Like the projects themselves, these statements will vary widely, but they should help readers/users understand the ideas about media/bookishness your project seeks to instantiate, the methods and materials you used in producing your book, and any habits of reading required to fully understand your book project. In short, your statement should summarize the intellectual work of your semester so that the labor of your project—both physical and mental—is clear. Depending on the form and media of your book, your statement may be direclty incorporated into your book, or it may be a separate document.

Finally, please be sure to include the following specific information:

+ Title
+ Dimensions, width x height, in inches
+ Number of pages (or comparable measurement)
+ Source material (if your book is based on another book, incorporates found materials, etc.)
+ Language(s)
+ The number of copies extant
+ Materials: what is the paper made out of? How is it bound? How was it printed? What fonts did you use? Are there other notable materials? Watercolors? Special inks? Give as much detail as possible.

  ###### Project Ownership and Sharing Permissions 

Your book ultimately belongs, but I will ask permission to exhibit it—at least temporarily—at Skeuomorph, as well as present photos/video online for other interested scholars and students. Essentially, in my experience these projects tend to be pretty cool. Since I know I'll be asking for this permission at some point, this semester I'm doing it preemptively! 

To let me know whether you are comfortable with this kind of sharing, please include the following permission statement with your artist's statement. You can just copy and paste, making sure to choose one where multiple options are possible, as indicated in all caps:

> I, _____________________________, GIVE / PREFER NOT TO GIVE Ryan Cordell permission to publicly reproduce images and/or video of my final IS583BL project online and in print for non-commercial purposes related to the BookLab course and Skeuomorph Press. The work will be appropriately credited and attributed to the fullest extent possible. He may share THE FULL BOOK / THE BOOK EXTERIOR ONLY 
> 
> ——————————————————
> Signature/ Date
  
###### Final Project Showcase

On the last day of class you will share your projects with each other and interested members of the campus community. We will discuss this event in more detail as the end of the semester approaches, but it will take the rough form of a poster presentation
